To add this voice pack to CrewChief 4.18.4.0 or similar:

1. From the CrewChief menu bar, select `File -> Open voice files folder`

2. This will open a File Explorer window to a location such as:
`C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\AppData\Local\CrewChiefV4\Sounds`

3. In this folder, you will see a folder called `alt`

4. Copy the main `VitorGenz` folder from the voice pack into the `alt` folder

5. Confirm that you now have a folder called `...\CrewChiefV4\Sounds\alt\VitorGenz`

6. Make sure to manually move the entire radio check folder at `...\alt\VitorGenz\radio_check_VitorGenz` to `...\CrewChiefV4\Sounds\voice\radio_check_VitorGenz`

7. Restart CrewChief and you will see `VitorGenz` in the dropdown list on the far right

8. CrewChief will prompt you to restart again, and you should hear VitorGenz answer the radio check alongside your spotter.

9. All done! Give Jim a well-deserved rest and enjoy frustrating a new engineer with your driving.

To remove, 1) swap back to Jim in the CrewChief UI.  2) delete the `VitorGenz` folder from `...\CrewChiefV4\Sounds\alt`. 3) delete the `radio_check_VitorGenz` folder from `...\CrewChiefV4\Sounds\voice`.
